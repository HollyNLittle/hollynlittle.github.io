            <p>
                I grew up with a father working in the burgeoning computer programming field.
                I remember computer related parts, books, and printers as being ubiquitous in our home. The memories of the noisy printers, the green and white striped paper, floppy discs and hard discs, are especially strong. I also recall watching the book and job titles as they changed over the years: COBOL, networking, systems engineer, and so on.
            </p>
            <p>
                Shortly after graduating from Miami University with a bachelor's degree in fine arts, I was working in the education field and raising my son.
            </p>
            <img src="images/RichardandMe.jpg" class="about-me-image-left" />
            <p>
                My father, who had long expressed frustration in what he found to be a dearth of good, knowledgeable computer programming professionals to hire on to complete different projects brought an O’Reilly book on Java programming to me, directing me to learn
                how to program so I could help him on his current project.
            </p>
            <p>
                Without so much as questioning the rather abrupt request to learn how to
                program, I delved in intent on helping and being sure not to let my dad down. I fell in love with O'Reilly and would recommend the Head First series for beginners.
            </p>
            <p>
                After I had been programming for some time, my father informed me that the company needed a website and directed
                me to create one. Again, turning to books, <img src="images/books.jpg" class="story-images" /> I delved into HTML, XHTML, CSS and Photoshop eventually building
                that website. I then took and passed the test to become an Adobe Certified Expert and then went on to teach
                Photoshop to others at the local community college.
            </p>
            <p>
                Once, the work at that company was complete, my father encouraged me to take the Java certification exam
                <img src="images/test.jpg" class="story-images" /> and start a job search as a computer programmer.
                However, despite his encouragement and having experienced success in utilizing the loops, arrays, object
                oriented programming, and so forth that I had intently studied. I was not ready to embark on a job search
                in the field, feeling no confidence in my skill set as I had no certificate, degree or experience working
                for a person that was not a relative.
            </p>
            <p>
                Instead, I continued in the education field as the art teacher at a daycare and later teaching and tutoring at the Lorain Juvenile Detention Facility, followed by work as a Resolution Specialist first at Nissan and then at Progressive where I am currently. Also, during this time I raised two sons and sent my oldest son off to college.
            </p>

            <p>
                Recently, I was considering my next steps career-wise when I heard an advertisement for We Can Code IT that had been playing on the radio for some time.  For some reason,
                this morning upon hearing the ad,
                I told myself, “I am going to do that.”
            </p>
            <img src="images/PortraitXtraSmall.jpg" class="about-me-image" />
            <p>
                <img src="images/learning-board.jpg" class="story-images" />
                Well into the We Can Code IT program, I have met
                new people from all walks of life pursuing similar goals, and I have learned more in a short period of time than I would have thought possible. Additionally, I have successfully completed projects using a myriad of programs and languages. The experience has been rewarding,
                challenging, fun and at times exceedingly frustrating, but I am so glad that I decided to walk down this path and am now tentatively making contacts and preparing to start my job search in earnest.
            </p>
            <p>
                When I explained to my manager that I was embarking on this journey, her response was enthusiastic support. She commented that I was brave. I encourage anyone reading this that has considered pursuing a similar life change, to be brave!
            </p>

            <p>
                After some years in the workforce, I have come to realize that the primary difference between those that do and the rest of us, is neither an expensive degree nor a brilliant mind, but a belief in their own abilities.

                    I hope my story helps anyone that has dealt with a similar situation:
                    a mid-life switch in careers. If you are considering a coding bootcamp
                    and have any questions, please feel free to either make use of the contact form below or one of my social media accounts.
